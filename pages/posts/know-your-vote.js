      <p>
        In 2022 the Toronto Public Library came to us with a problem: Toronto
        voters didn&apos;t have the resources to make education voting
        decisions. Our goal was to learn as much as we could about voters and
        candidates to build a platform that helped both parties.

            . From our surveys we were able to find a proto-target group of what
            we&apos;ll call &quot;community leaders&quot; that are engaged and
            engaging.
          </li>
          <li>
            User Interviews: Candidates are already a perfect target group and,
            thanks to our survey responses we were able to recruit our
            &quot;community leader&quot; interviewees. We ran 12 interviews
            with each group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usability Testing: During prototyping we performed usability testing
            of the public-facing platform and the CMS for voters and candidates,
            respectively. Each test included 5-6 testers.

      <h1>Branding</h1>

        As this was a Toronto Public Library product, it was necessary to align
        with TPL&apos;s branding guidelines. However, as youth civic engagement
        was low, we wanted to give the site a youthful feel. This was easy with
        TPL&apos;s branding. Shout out to{" "}

        Future Iterations
      </h1>
      <h2>
        General Voter Education
      </h2>
      <p>
        While this first iteration is based on helping voters learn about candidates and get links to voter information for election day, it wasn&apos;t within scope to create a more broad education space. This can be useful for voters who want to know more about the process and their role but we were also aware of TPL&apos;s student education initiatives, which we would love to support.
      </p>
      <h2>
        White label Platform
      </h2>
      <p>
        A platform like this can be useful across cities, provinces, municipalities, etc. but it can also be useful in non-government contexts. We purposefully designed and developed the platform to be brand-agnostic, based on reusable components, and accessible to make white labelling easier.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Candidate and Community Leader Analytics
      </h2>
      <p>
        We built basic analytics into the platform for candidates. This is currently used to show candidates how many people are reading their answers and sharing their page. Of course, if a candidate has not submitted their answers they can see the missed opportunity.
        <br/>
        The next milestone would include more robust analytics to help candidates and community leaders measure their impact and determine the appropriate effort to put into the platform.
